# Frontend (React + TypeScript)

This folder contains a minimal React + TypeScript frontend scaffold for the Bitchanic platform.

Install dependencies and run locally:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Notes:
- The app uses Material-UI, Redux Toolkit and ethers.js for MetaMask integration.
- Web3 requires MetaMask in the browser and a local Hardhat node (or connect to a testnet).
